## Reflection

In what ways were the use of linked lists particularly appropriate for this assignment?

Linked lists were appropriate due to the almost constant required use of adding and removing items from the lists as linked lists are more efficient rather than arrays or any other structure. 


What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?

Figuring out all of the different exceptions. 

What do you feel you learned from this assignment?

I learned that linked lists can have many different applications that are not always obvious.
